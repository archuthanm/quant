                <p class="bio-intro-text lead-paragraph">
                    I am a Computer Science student at <strong>King's College London</strong> driven by the intersection of <strong>performance and design</strong>. While my foundation is in algorithms, my engineering philosophy is rooted in <strong>craftsmanship and modularity</strong>. I am dedicated to bridging the gap between the <strong>invisible machinery</strong> of distributed systems and the <strong>pixel-perfect details</strong> of the frontend - building solutions that are as resilient as they are beautiful.
                </p>
                
                <div class="bio-body-group">
                    <p class="bio-intro-text">
                        My engineering philosophy centers on the trade-offs inherent in distributed systems. Software development isn't just about writing syntax; it's about making architectural decisions under constraints. I am fascinated by the friction between <strong>consistency and availability</strong> (CAP theorem) and the rigorous process required to build backends that are resilient enough to fail gracefully, yet efficient enough to process high-throughput data with minimal latency.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="bio-intro-text">
                        I approach development with a mindset of <strong>craftsmanship and automation</strong>. I believe that "it works on my machine" is a bug, not a defense. Whether I’m optimising SQL queries, containerising applications with Docker, or designing RESTful APIs, my goal is to reduce friction and eliminate fragility. I treat infrastructure as code and view maintainability as a first-class feature, ensuring that the systems I build today don't become the technical debt of tomorrow.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="bio-intro-text">
                        Ultimately, I see engineering as the art of complexity management. I am motivated by environments where high-availability isn't a buzzword but a requirement - where I can contribute to building robust, <strong>cloud-native solutions</strong> that serve users reliably without missing a heartbeat.
